# Stereo DSM Generation Pipelines for SPOT and Pleiades

## Overview
This repository provides a streamlined way to generate a Digital Surface Model (DSM) from SPOT 6 and Pleiades stereo imagery using NASA's Ames Stereo Pipeline.

## Setup
Refer to Section 2.6 for ASP installation using Conda and for general guidelines of installation https://stereopipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#conda-intro

or use the .yml file for recreating the environment. 
```bash
conda env create -f asp_environment.yml
```

Ensure `stereo`, `point2dem`, and other ASP tools are available in your system PATH.

## Usage
1. Place all stereo images in `data`
    - SPOT raw files should be in `data/tif`
    - Pleiades raw files should be in `data/jp2` (Plieades data has JP2 images that needs to be converted into tif)
2. Define input and output path, variables in config.json file. A sample file for both the sensors is provided (config_spot.json,config_plieades.json)
3. Run the pipeline:
```bash
python run_pipeline.py config.json 
```

Outputs will be saved in `results/`.
